- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gfergusonQA
- I work with Freakscene.us currently as the Technical Operations Specialist. Formerly a Senior QA Engineer at Mercari US for over 4 years, and over 6 years with the same company. Also a Computer Science BS undergrad at PCC/PSU with expected graduation in Spring 2027. I also will be obtaining my Associate of Science degree this year, Spring 2025 from PCC.

- Some things you will find in my repo are projects from various programming courses, and another website repo for an Info Systems & Design class from the CIS pathway at PCC.
